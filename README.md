Bingo Mod
=========

To install, put the mod in the mods directory and install factorio stdlib via the mod portal.

Starting a map in single player will automatically start a bingo game. Starting in multiplayer will pause the game and display a start button, so the game can be started when all players have joined. Currently all players get independent boards but play on the same map, and it is impossible to add players to the bingo game later (still in development).

Rules: To complete the board, finish all five tasks in any row or column. In a race between multiple players, the person who does manages this first wins the race.

The bingo board depends only on the map seed, so if two players play the same map seed then they will also get the same boards.
