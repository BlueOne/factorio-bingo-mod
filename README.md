Bingo Mod
=========

How To Play
-----------
Starting a map in single player while the mod is active will automatically start a bingo game. Starting in multiplayer will pause the game and display a start button, so the game can be started when all players have joined. 

To complete the board, finish all five tasks in any row or column. 

If the game is started on the same map seed for two players, both will get the same bingo board.
