Bingo Mod
=========

To install, put the mod in the mods directory and install factorio stdlib via the mod portal.

The bingo game starts automatically when the game is started. Currently if multiple people join the game, they can complete tasks on the same board, to allow races between player groups.

Rules: To complete the board, finish all five tasks in any row or column. In a race between multiple players, the person who does manages this first wins the race.

The bingo board depends only on the map seed, so if two players play the same map seed then they will also get the same boards.
